COVID-19 Prevention Network (CoVPN) Volunteer Screening Registry Analysis


A major and critical need for the field is the ability to provide some level of 
confidence in predicting individual risk for infection and disease based on a 
survey of demographic detail, e.g. CoVPN registry. If clinical trial sites can 
easily identify and enroll patients who are most likely to become an endpoint, 
the pre-specified count of endpoints needed for trial completion will be 
reached sooner and sufficient evidence will be available sooner for the FDA 
to evaluate vaccine efficacy. 

The main data source used to inform this analysis is the CoVPN Vaccine Trial Screening Registry 
powered by Oracle APEX. The online survey is available here
